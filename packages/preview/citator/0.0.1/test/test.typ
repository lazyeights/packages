// "In reviewing the Board's determination on the questionof obviousness, we review the Board's legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for substantial evidence." #case[_Becton, Dickinson & Co. v. Baxter Corp. Englewood_, 998 F.3d 1337, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2021)] (internal quotation marks, citation, and alterations omitted). "What a reference teaches and the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art are questions f fact which we review for substantial evidence." #case[_In re Cuozzo Speed Techs., LLC_, 793 F.3d 1268, 1280 (Fed. Cir. 2015)]\; @becton998f3d1337[30].

// “[A]n invention is not rendered ineligible for patent simply because it involves an abstract concept. Applications of such concepts to a new and useful end . . . remain eligible for patent protection.” #case[_Alice Corp. Pty. v. CLS Bank Int’l_, 573 U.S. 208, 217 (2014)] (asking whether the invention “claim[s] the ‘buildin[g] block[s]’ of human ingenuity” or “integrate[s] the building blocks into something more”). In Alice, the Supreme Court set forth a two-step framework for determining patent eligibility under [35 U.S.C. § 101]. A claim is ineligible under section 101 if “(1) it is ‘directed to’ a patent-ineligible concept, i.e., a law of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea, and (2), if so, the particular elements of the claim, considered ‘both individually and as an ordered combination’ do not add enough to ‘transform the nature of the claim’ into a patent-eligible application.’” #case[_Elec. Power Grp., LLC v. Alstom S.A._, 830 F.3d 1350, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2016)] (quoting @alice573us208[217] (internal quotations omitted)).

// Under Rule 12(b)(6), a defendant may move to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. A plaintiff must state “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” #case(key: "twombly")[_Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly_, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)]. A claim has “facial plausibility” if the plaintiff pleads facts that “allow[] the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” #case[_Ashcroft v. Iqbal_, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)].
